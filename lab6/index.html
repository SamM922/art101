		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to learn about JavaScript arrays and objects and how they are used.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The biggest problem we faced was that printing objects directly from JavaScript doesn't look good at all.
			So we spent some time styling the webpage and making it look like it fits. Samuel also had some trouble finding CSS
			elements to add without messing heavily with the pageâ€™s look. Furthermore, we had some syntax errors with the console
			logging in the debug menu.</p>
