	<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this lab is to practice methods of debugging and share my experiences.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>None of my labs needed fixing, so coming up with something to put here was a challenge in itself.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
		<h2>Past Experiences</h2>
		<p>One of the most infamous examples of issues I couldn't find with my code was for Lab 7. None of my JavaScript was working, but it turns out all of it was working perfectly well and in the wrong file!
		A lot of debugging involves carefully reading through your code for anything you missed or typed wrong so knowing exactly what your code should look like and using neat spacing and comments are two very useful tips.</p>
		<h2>Debugging Example</h2>
		<p>Press CTRL/Command + Shift + J to open the console and see an example of a common debugging problem!</p>
